## Dataset Used  
- **Dataset Name:** Diabetes Dataset  
- **Source:** [GitHub Link](https://gist.github.com/boersmamarcel/4202286/raw/diabetes.csv)  
- **Description:** Contains patient information and medical features such as age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar, with a target variable measuring diabetes progression after one year.  
- **Number of rows/columns:** Check in Colab using `df.info()`  
- **Target variable:** `target` – Disease progression measurement after one year  
- **Features used:** Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age and Outcome

---

## Preprocessing Steps  
- Checked for missing values; dataset is already standardized.  
- Converted all features to numeric (dataset is numeric-ready).  
- No categorical encoding required since all features are numerical.  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (75% training, 25% testing).  

---

## Model Explanation  
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression  
- Linear Regression predicts continuous numerical values from input features.  
- **Features used in the model:**  Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age and Outcome
- **Target variable:** target (disease progression after one year)  

---

## Model Training  
- Dataset split using `train_test_split` from Scikit-Learn: 75% training, 25% testing  
- Model trained on `X_train` and `y_train`  
- Predictions made on `X_test`  

---

## Evaluation Metrics  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): *calculated in notebook*  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): *calculated in notebook*  
- R² Score: *calculated in notebook*  

---

## Actual vs Predicted  
- First 20 predictions vs actual target values displayed in the notebook (`comparison.head(20)`)  
- Optional: Confusion matrix generated by converting regression output to classes using median  

---

## Instructions to Run  
1. Open the Colab notebook (`diabetes_prediction.ipynb`) in Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset file `diabetes.csv` to Colab  
3. Run all cells in order  
4. Check outputs:  
   - Dataset info (`df.info()`)  
   - Preprocessing steps  
   - Linear Regression predictions  
   - Actual vs Predicted table  
   - Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)  
   - Optional: Pseudo confusion matrix

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python 3  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  
- Scikit-Learn for machine learning
